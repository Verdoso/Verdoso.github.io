I have been developing software professionally for many years, especially around the Java ecosystem. 

Being part of a small team for many years has made me gain experience in the whole lifecycle of the products I develop, from talking to users and gathering the requirements, to doing the support and maintenance of the production environment and everything in between (coding, database design, UI/UX, bug fixing, CI/CD...).

I have also worked as a consultant/contractor for a couple of big companies where I was part of the architecture/development team, doing performance analysis, mentoring, architecture revisions etc. 

Even though my main job now usually involves Java, I'm not tied to any language and I've also done real work with PL/SQL, Groovy, Kotlin and my own experiments with Scala, JRuby Rust and many others.
